# Online_Examination
A very short project depicting how online examination on web can be conducted. Assuming few things, it was kept minimal and short, but we tried to integrate HTML5 concepts along with few designing concepts of CSS3. It is a pure HTML,CSS and JavaScript based project so no server side technlogy has been used.
